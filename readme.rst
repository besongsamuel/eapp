What is EAPP
###################

EAPP (Epicerie a petit prix) is a web project that allows you to compare store prices and produce the user a better
grocery shopping list. You add grocery items to a cart and at 'Checkout', the system computes an optimized list of 
items by selecting items from stores closest to you with the lowest prices.
